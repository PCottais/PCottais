I’m @PCottais, student in master MAS (Mathématiques appliquées, statistique) at l'Institut Agro Rennes-Angers.
I also work for the French National Institute for Agriculture, Food, and Environment (INRAE), at a research unit in ecological functioning, management and governance of agri-forestry landscapes (UMR Dynafor).
